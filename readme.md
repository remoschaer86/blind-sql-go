## Running the Scripts

To run this app you simply have to install Golang on your system and clone the repository.
For a new attack to work you only need to replace the host constant in the /internal/attack/conig.go. After that you need to cd into the individual folders in the cmd folder and run the individual scripts using the "go run ." command.
